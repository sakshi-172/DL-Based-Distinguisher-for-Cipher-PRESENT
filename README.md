# DL-Based Distinguisher for Cipher PRESENT

This project, developed during a research internship at the Scientific Analysis Group (SAG), DRDO, leverages deep learning techniques to distinguish ciphertext generated by the PRESENT lightweight block cipher from truly random data.

Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the project explores the use of AI in differential cryptanalysis — enabling statistical pattern recognition in cipher output. The developed model significantly outperforms traditional classifiers and demonstrates the feasibility of neural network-based distinguishers in cryptography.
